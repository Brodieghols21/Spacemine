A relatively small mod; adds several space related items and materials to the game, ways to use them, and ways to obtain them.A relatively small mod; adds several items and materials to the game, ways to use them, and ways to obtain them.

I have added a bit of stuff:

    Asteroid
    Large Asteroid
    Asteroid Belt
    Moon
    Planet
    Star
    Solar System
    Dwarf Planet
    Brown Dwarf
    White Dwarf
    Black Dwarf
    Black Hole
    Red Supergiant
    Supernova
    Neutron Star
    Pulsar
    Solar System Cluster
    Galaxy
    Galaxy Cluster
    Universe
    Multiverse
    Super Massive Black Hole

 

All these items have blocks, are edible, and can be crafted into swords and armor currently.

The swords and armor are quite strong, but that is because they get very expensive, to the point where you need millions of asteroids to make one multiverse.

 

The foods are also quite powerful, and some give effects

 

Since the asteroids are so hard to craft, and are not default having an EMC value, I added a block that will overtime drop asteroids.

 

I added upgrades for the shrink laser, craft it or use the next tier's center item on the previous tier.
